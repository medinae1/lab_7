Welcome back, cosmic explorers!

Today the crew and I came across a discovery in the deep expanse of the universe, we believe we may have interacted with an alien life form never before seen!

<strong> Alien Encounter </strong>

Today was cleaning day on the ship, and while in the middle of cleaning out my workspace, the entire craft began to rattle slightly, causing some of the objects inside to fly around haphazardly. Turns out, while in auto-pilot, an alien craft bumped into our ship! The crew went to investigate the rattling and after peering out a window we saw a massive mettalic creature with tentacle appendages! It turns out it had latched onto our ship by accident, and the sliding of its tentacles against the ship caused the rattling. Unfortunately, I wasn't quick enough to take a picture, and it went off deeper into the starry abyss.

That's all for today! Stay safe out there!
